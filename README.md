okey, so its the project that i have been working for quite a log of time now.
I`ts not copy-paste, 
There was truely a lot struggling with errors, that`s why it took me that long.
In the nearest future I`m going to add things like:
-adding a new posts and of course displaying them in the proper subpage.
-possibility to chat with people that would like to join our event and based on those messages accept new users to the event or reject them.
-fullfil of event shown by some kind of progress bar in every post
That is truely huge application, but I think the idea is very good.
Some of the details you might have missed by just looking on the page are:
-api request that guess gender based on the name.
-autmoatic big letter on the beggining of the name.
- the forgot password pop up.
